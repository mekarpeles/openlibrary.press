# openlibrary.press

Openlibrary Press is an EXPERIMENTAL, not for profit, open publishing platform which gives authors access to free and openly accessible tools for self-publishing their books. Open Library Press is inspired by the values of OpenLibrary.org but is an independent experiment and is not an official project of the Internet Archive.

## What types of tools?

OpenLibrary Press aspires to offer authors tools to create bookcovers, format their digital books, facilitate free storage for their books, register their books within the OpenLibrary.org catalog, and help connect authors with possible vendor integrations to facilitate the independent sale of their works.

## What isn't OpenLibrary.press

* OpenLibrary.press is not an official project of the Internet Archive, it is a thought experiment into providing alternative self-publishing avenues for authors.
* OpenLibrary.press is itself not a book vendor and, while it may facilitate authors in indepndently selling their book using their own vendor accounts and make digital storage available for authors to host and distribute their books, does not itself sell books or process payment.

## What is the goal of Openlibrary.press?

The goal is simply to create more opportunity, to encourage the creation of new open source publishing tools, and to help give authors more options in addition to traditional publishers.
